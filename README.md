# CataclysmAPI
This API is built to store a ton of random ass data pertaining to the many different projects created by Cataclysm-Interactive.

## What data is stored currently in this API?
Currently, I have three tables in a SQL server set up for this API. 

Kirbo bot is a Discord Bot I created. [Kirbo Bot](https://github.com/cataclysm-interactive/kirbo-bot)
1. Kirbo Bot Users
2. Kirbo Bot Factions
3. Kirbo Bot Map tiles (Used in Faction wars. Used to be a part of Factions, but I moved it to it's own part to make it easier to add functionality.)
